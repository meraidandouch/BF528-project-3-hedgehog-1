# Project Description

This repository contains the code and writeup for Project 3.

Here we attempt to partially reproduce the findings from Wang et al. 2014 by focusing specifically on toxgroup 2 from this study. This study sought to compare two methods of measuring gene expression - Microarrays and RNA-seq. Gene expression was measured using both techniques in rats exposed to a variety of different chemicals, and after their respective analysis pipelines were completed, the results from each method were compared.
